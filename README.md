## AI-Projects
These are some AI projects build in Colab, This cover the full process of building , This cover the full process of building a basic machine learning. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring the  error. The exportation has been uploaded in Jupite notebook

## Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning algorithms adhere to similar criteria, a framework we will also adopt here. This outline delineates the machine learning problem at hand and explores potential solutions.

1.-Project Steps
2.-State a hypothesis.
3.-Read the data.
4.-(If necessary) Validate the data to predict your target.
5.-Clean the data for ML.
6.-Pick an error metric.
7.-Split your data.
8.-Train a model.
