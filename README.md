## AI-Projects
These are some AI projects build in Colab, This cover the full process of building , This cover the full process of building a basic machine learning. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring the  error. The exportation has been uploaded in Jupite notebook

## Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning algorithms adhere to similar criteria, a framework we will also adopt here. This outline delineates the machine learning problem at hand and explores potential solutions.


>Project Steps


>State a hypothesis.


>Read the data.


>(If necessary) Validate the data to predict your target.


>Clean the data for ML.


>Pick an error metric.


>Split your data.


> Train a model.
